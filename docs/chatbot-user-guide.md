# RAG Chatbot User Guide

This guide explains how to use the embedded RAG chatbot in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book documentation.

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is embedded directly into all book pages, allowing you to ask questions about the content and receive AI-generated responses based on the book's material.

## Getting Started

### 1. Opening the Chatbot
- Look for the floating chat button in the bottom-right corner of any documentation page
- Click the button to open the chat interface
- The chat window will appear on top of the current page content

### 2. Asking Questions
- Type your question in the text input field at the bottom of the chat window
- Press Enter or click the send button to submit your query
- The chatbot will process your question and provide a response based on the book content
- Responses typically include source attributions showing where the information came from

### 3. Understanding Responses
- **AI Responses**: Shown with a distinct styling and include source attributions
- **Source Attributions**: Links to specific sections of the book that informed the response
- **Confidence Score**: A measure of how confident the system is in its response (0-1 scale)

## Advanced Features

### Text Selection Queries
1. **Select Text**: Highlight any text on the current page by clicking and dragging
2. **Ask About Selection**: The chatbot will automatically detect your selection and offer to ask about it
3. **Contextual Responses**: The AI will focus its response on the selected text while still drawing from the broader book content

### Session Continuity
- Your chat history is maintained during your current session
- Navigate between pages without losing your conversation history
- Each session has a unique ID that persists across page reloads

## Best Practices

### Effective Queries
- Be specific in your questions for better results
- Use natural language as you would when asking a human expert
- If the first response isn't helpful, try rephrasing your question
- Include context in your questions when needed (e.g., "What does this mean in the context of humanoid robots?")

### Using Source Attributions
- Click on source links to navigate directly to the referenced content
- Use sources to verify the AI's responses
- Explore related sections to deepen your understanding

### Text Selection Tips
- Select relevant paragraphs or sentences when you want to ask about specific content
- The longer the selection, the more context the AI has to work with
- Combine general questions with specific text selections for comprehensive answers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Response or Long Wait Times
- **Problem**: The chatbot takes more than 10 seconds to respond
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again. Complex queries may take longer to process.

#### Unhelpful Responses
- **Problem**: The response doesn't address your question
- **Solution**: Try rephrasing your question or being more specific. You can also select relevant text to provide context.

#### Chatbot Not Appearing
- **Problem**: The floating chat button is not visible
- **Solution**: Refresh the page or check if browser extensions are blocking the chatbot interface.

#### Text Selection Not Working
- **Problem**: Selected text doesn't appear in the chat interface
- **Solution**: Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Some older browsers may have limited support.

### Error Messages
- **"Failed to send query"**: Usually indicates a network connectivity issue. Check your connection and try again.
- **"Backend service unavailable"**: The AI service may be temporarily down. Wait a few minutes and try again.
- **"Session expired"**: Your chat session may have timed out. Start a new conversation if needed.

## Limitations

### What the Chatbot Can Do
- Answer questions about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts
- Provide explanations of technical terms and processes

### What the Chatbot Cannot Do
- Access information outside the book content
- Provide real-time updates beyond the book's publication date
