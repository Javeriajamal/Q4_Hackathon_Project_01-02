# Glossary: Digital Twin Simulation Concepts

This glossary defines key terms used throughout Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).

## A

### Accuracy vs. Performance Trade-off
The balance between simulation fidelity and computational efficiency in physics engines.

## D

### Digital Twin
A virtual representation of a physical robot or system that mirrors its real-world counterpart in behavior and characteristics.

## E

### Environment (Simulation)
The virtual space where the digital twin operates with physics and environmental properties.

### LiDAR
Light Detection and Ranging sensor that generates simulated point clouds with noise modeling.

## P

### Physics Engine
Software component that simulates physical laws (gravity, collisions, friction, dynamics) to approximate real-world behavior.

### Physics Simulation
The process of modeling real-world physical laws like gravity, collisions, and friction to create realistic robot behaviors in virtual environments.

## R

### Robot Model
Virtual representation of a physical robot with kinematic and dynamic properties.

## S

### Sensor Simulation
