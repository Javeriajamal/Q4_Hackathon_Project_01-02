# Control Systems and Actuation

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the control architectures used in humanoid robotics
- Explore different actuation technologies and their applications
- Analyze feedback control systems for stable humanoid operation

## Introduction
The control systems of humanoid robots represent one of the most complex aspects of their design, requiring sophisticated algorithms to coordinate multiple degrees of freedom while maintaining balance and achieving desired tasks. These systems must handle the dynamic nature of bipedal locomotion, environmental interactions, and real-time sensory feedback.

### Control Architecture

#### Hierarchical Control Structure
Humanoid robots typically employ multiple levels of control:

**High-Level Planning**
- Task-level planning and sequencing
- Path planning for navigation
- Behavioral decision-making
- Integration with AI systems

**Mid-Level Coordination**
- Whole-body motion planning
- Balance and posture control
- Gait pattern generation
- Multi-objective optimization

**Low-Level Control**
- Joint-level servo control
- Hardware interface management
- Real-time safety monitoring
- Direct motor command execution

### Balance Control
