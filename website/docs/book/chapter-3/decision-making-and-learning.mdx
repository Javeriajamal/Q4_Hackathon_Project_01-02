# Decision Making and Learning

## Learning Objectives
- Understand AI algorithms for humanoid robot decision making
- Explore machine learning approaches for robotic behavior
- Analyze the integration of learning with real-time control

## Introduction
Decision making and learning form the cognitive core of humanoid robots, enabling them to adapt to new situations, improve their performance over time, and make intelligent choices based on sensory input and goals. These systems bridge the gap between perception and action, allowing robots to operate autonomously in complex, dynamic environments.
