**Purpose**: Validate plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task generation
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](../plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on technical architecture and design
- [x] Written for technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Technical requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All key decisions are documented
- [x] Architecture is clearly defined
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Plan Readiness

- [x] All technical requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Architecture addresses primary flows
- [x] Plan meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into architecture description

## Notes

- All items have been validated and meet the required standards
- Plan is ready for task generation phase
