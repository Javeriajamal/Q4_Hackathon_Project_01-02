# Quickstart Guide: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Module Overview

This educational module explores the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem as an integrated "AI-Robot Brain" for humanoid robots. The module covers three key components:

1. **Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated perception and Visual SLAM
3. **Nav2**: Navigation and path planning for humanoid robots

## Learning Path

### Chapter 1: Perception & Simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Understand how photorealistic simulation enables robot perception training
- Learn about synthetic data generation and domain randomization
- Explore the role of simulation in bridging the sim-to-real gap

### Chapter 2: Real-World Perception with Isaac ROS
- Discover Visual SLAM (VSLAM) fundamentals and real-time localization
- Understand sensor fusion and hardware acceleration
- Learn how simulation-trained models transfer to real robots

### Chapter 3: Navigation & Path Planning with Nav2
- Explore autonomous navigation concepts for humanoid robots
- Understand challenges of bipedal locomotion vs. wheeled robots
- Learn how perception outputs integrate with navigation decisions

## Key Concepts You'll Master

- The perception → decision → action loop in humanoid robots
